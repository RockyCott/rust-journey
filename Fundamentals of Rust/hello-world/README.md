# Hello World

One of the most common programs to write when learning a new programming language is the "Hello, World!" program. This program simply prints the text "Hello, World!" to the console. It is a simple program that helps you understand the basic syntax and structure of a programming language like Rust.

In Rust, you can write the "Hello, World!" program using the `println!` macro. The `println!` macro is used to print text to the console. Here's how you can write the "Hello, World!" program in Rust:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, World!");
}
```

In this program, the `fn main()` function is the entry point of the program. The `println!` macro is used to print the text "Hello, World!" to the console. When you run this program, you will see the text "Hello, World!" printed to the console.

Let's write the "Hello, World!" program in Rust and run it to see the output.

## Steps to Run the Program (cargo)

1. Open a terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the `hello-world` project.
3. Run the following command to build and run the program:

```bash
cargo run
```
4. You will see the text "Hello, World!" printed to the console.
5. Congratulations! You have successfully written and run the "Hello, World!" program in Rust.
